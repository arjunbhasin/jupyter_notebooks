    "# Kinematic Modelling of Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a general case of 'n' rigid body links connected together to form a serial kinematic chain. Let the 'n'-dimensional configuration space of the manipulator be given by $$q_a = [q_{a_1} \\  q_{a_2} \\  \\ldots \\ q_{a_n}]^T$$ and let $$\\xi_a = [\\xi_{a_1} \\ \\xi_{a_2} \\ \\ldots \\ \\xi_{a_m}]^T$$ define the 'm'-dimensional operational space of the manipulator arm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this study we consider a $3$ DOF PUMA like manipulator with no wrist mounted on a mobile platform. We also ignore the orientation of the end-effector and only consider its position in space. Hence both the configuration space and the operational space become $3$ dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out the direct kinematic model of the arm, i.e. a mapping from the joint angle space to the operational space, appropriate frames must be places on the links as per the Denavitâ€“Hartenberg convention \\cite{craig2005}. Table 3.1 shows the DH parameters for the $3$ DOF PUMA like arm and Figure 3.2(b) shows the assigned frames as per the convention."
